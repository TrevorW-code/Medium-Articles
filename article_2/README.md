# [Intro to Webhooks and How to Receive them with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-webhooks-and-how-to-receive-them-with-python-d5f6dd634476)

This was pretty embarrasing, but in my job, I was trying to create a webhook to connect directly with a websocket endpoint. I learned today that they are _totally_ different, but the same underlying principle of efficient data transfer is still there. I'm excited to see how I can use this in small personal projects. Overall, I was glad I read Rahul's article. Till next time.
