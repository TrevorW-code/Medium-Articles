# Medium Articles

After reading several articles from Medium, Towards Data Science and Better Programming, I decided that it would be cool to follow along, so I did. Here's the code! 

- [Article 1 - Creating Websockets in Python](https://github.com/TrevorW-code/Medium-Articles/tree/main/article_1)
> For my recent NLP Job, I've been in charge of implementing some websocket behaviour for our clients. The API we are using is built on this package as it turns out, which is really cool. Websockets are a really interesting part of Comp Sci, a topic I definitely want to dive into more. Stay tuned :)

- [Article 2 - Intro to Webhooks and How to Receive them with Python](https://github.com/TrevorW-code/Medium-Articles/tree/main/article_2)
> This was also a great article. It helped me figure out the difference between webhooks and websockets, because there is a difference! From what I understand, webhook are essentially "Let me know when you get/have this", which seems like a way better way of requesting data than polling. I'm excited to see how I can use this in some of my upcoming projects.

- [Article 3 - The Beginner’s Guide to Selenium With Python](https://github.com/TrevorW-code/Medium-Articles/tree/main/article_3)
> Learning the basics of Selenium was really great. I can totally see the utility of this. From unittesting web apps to making bots (what I did for the article), Selenium is really pleasant to work with, and I am excited to start working with it more and more. 

- [Article 4 - How to Build Simple Recommender Systems in Python](https://github.com/TrevorW-code/Medium-Articles/tree/main/article_4)
> Not quite done yet, but will be finished soon.
