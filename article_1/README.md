# [How To Create a WebSocket in Python](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-create-a-websocket-in-python-b68d65dbd549)

This was a really cool article. Dieter Jordens really explains how websockets work, and helps you build a server, a "message consumer" and a "message producer". He shows some really simple async methods, something I am still totally learning about. It was a really great article, I'd totally recommend to anyone who wants to learn a little more about how websockets work.
